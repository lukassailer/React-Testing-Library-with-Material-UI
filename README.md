# React Testing Library with Material-UI

In this repository you will find tests for the MUI Comonents:

- Input
- Checkbox
- RadioGroup
- Select

I am using various queries in this example to showcase how you can use them.

Note that these are not always the best queries to use,
**the best practice is to query for things the user can perceive** (whenever possible).

For more info on what query to use click here: [Which query should i use?](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-which-query)

And for a more in-depth query documentation click here: [Queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-queries)
